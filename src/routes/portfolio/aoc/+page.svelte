        <h2>Why Advent of Code?</h2>
        <p>Advent of Code is a yearly set of coding challenges designed to put one’s programming skills to the test. Every day of December, from the 1st to the 25th, a new challenge releases, steadily getting more complicated and putting your skills to the test in everything from graph traversal to defragmentation to memoization. It is a DSA masterclass.</p>
        <p>The challenges are intentionally presented in a way that is language-agnostic. With only a set of instructions, an example input, and a user-specific real input, the programmer may (nay <i>should</i>) use any tool at their disposal to get to a single numerical solution.</p>
        <p>Crucially, upon successfully solving the challenge, a craftily-prepared <b>part 2</b> is revealed with a new set of instructions for the same input, often pressing the programmer to <b>return</b> to the drawing board. Perhaps their initial recursive algorithm from part 1 now causes a stack overflow, or maybe the 100 values the user needs to cross-compare have become 100,000,000. The programmer would quite like their program to terminate in their lifetime.</p>
        <p>For me, <b>Advent of Code may well be the single most impactful resource for building coding proficiency that I have used.</b> From humble beginnings two years ago, where I first attempted the puzzles in a single C# file, to more ambitious steps in AoC’s 2023 and 2024, where I dove headfirst for the first time into JavaScript and Golang, Advent of Code is the manifested proof that <b>practice makes perfect</b>.</p>
        <p>So I invite you, dear reader, to leaf through my many solutions over many puzzles, and bear witness to this auto-biographical chronicle of code. To scrutinize the difference between my first clunky rough-cuts and more recent gems. To acknowledge the improvements yet critique the still present imperfections. To witness the clear cross-paradigm influences of C# on JavaScript, and of JavaScript on Go.</p>
        <p>And to maybe ask yourself if those advent plans you had this Christmas could wait until January?</p>
